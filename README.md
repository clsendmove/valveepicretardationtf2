# What valve did

2.Did a game-ban wave.
3.Implemented a way to detect steam alt accounts
4.Revived the report system.
5.Sandboxie/FireJail Detection (pretty ez actually)

# Solutions & How valve did it
1.HWID Banning; Spoof your HWID. But make sure your spoofer spoofs; Machine GUID, Mac Adress, HDD/SSD Serial Numbers. Steam logs your HWID on startup/log in.
2.Detecting Alts; When you make alts, DO NOT; Disable Steam Guard. Enable it using something like steamguard-cli. Do not USE the steam app on your phone to 2FA.
3.Reporting System; You can't really do anything about this one, just dont anti-aim, and you'll probably be fine, Just dont get alot of reports.
4.Sandboxie/FireJail Detection; There's to my knowledge no way to use Sandboxie/Firejail without getting detected and nuked from valve. You can keep on making alts every 7 hours to host with sandboxie/firejail, but its pointless tbh.
5.Note; If you have something like an expensive item, i recommend you sell it, genuinely. Also, ALWAYS Cheat on F2P accounts.
